# Titanic Dataset with Scikit-Learn Pipeline

## Overview

This notebook demonstrates how to effectively use the `sklearn` pipeline to preprocess data and train a model on the Titanic dataset. The notebook aims to simplify the machine learning workflow by organizing the sequence of operations into a streamlined pipeline, making the process more productive and less error-prone.

## Features of the Notebook

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
- **Pipeline Creation**: The notebook shows how to chain multiple preprocessing steps and a model into a single pipeline.
- **Model Training**: Uses a Decision Tree classifier to predict survival on the Titanic dataset.
- **Feature Selection**: Includes a step for selecting the most relevant features using `SelectKBest`.

## Advantages of Using Pipelines

1. **Simplifies Workflow**: All steps of the machine learning process, from preprocessing to model training, are encapsulated in a single object.
2. **Reproducibility**: Pipelines ensure that the same preprocessing steps are applied consistently, reducing the risk of errors.
3. **Ease of Experimentation**: You can easily swap components like the model or preprocessing steps within the pipeline without changing much of the code structure.
4. **Better Integration**: Pipelines are naturally compatible with grid search and cross-validation, facilitating hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation.

## How to Run

1. Load the notebook in a Jupyter environment.
2. Ensure you have all the required libraries installed:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
    ```
3. Run each cell step-by-step to preprocess the data and train the model using the pipeline.

## Conclusion

This notebook serves as an excellent introduction to the concept of pipelines in `sklearn`, showcasing how they can make machine learning workflows more efficient, organized, and easier to manage.
